JS30-01 Drum Kit
----------------
A drum kit I created on 2019.09.03, Day #1 of 30 days of code in the JavaScript30.com class. I learned how to setup code pen, add assets like sound and CSS, about keyboard events, playing audio, a couple methods including querySelector and querySelectorAll, how to edit CSS by using the classList property, and listening for a transitionEnd event.
